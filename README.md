# Blackjack Game
Welcome to our unique version of Blackjack! While it shares similarities with the traditional game, there are distinct differences in how we handle Aces (A) and face cards (J, Q, K).

- For Aces (A):
Players can choose either a value of 1 or 11.
- For Jacks (J):
Players subtract 10 from the total of their previous cards. If there are no previous cards, the value becomes -10.
- For Queens (Q):
Players double the total of their previous cards. If there are no previous cards, the value becomes 0 (0 * 2).
- For Kings (K):
A random number between 0 and 10 is generated.

We give you 500$ for your FREE BETTING!
Feel free to enjoy our Blackjack game with these unique twists! Good luck!

# Issue
Despite having various Blackjack source codes available, we struggled to find one that directly displayed cards in the command prompt console. Our team desired a more visually appealing implementation, leading to difficulties in locating a codebase that met our requirements.

The challenge was addressed by structuring the cards into multiple lines using a doubly linked list, as illustrated above. This approach allowed us to create a visually striking representation, setting our project apart from others.
